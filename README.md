This repo contains the code for the paper SCI-Verifier:  Scientific Verifier with Thinking.

## Overview

SCI-VerifyBench is a cross-disciplinary benchmark for evaluating the scientific verification abilities of large language models (LLMs), covering mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and general scientific QA. It includes real LLM responses enhanced with domain-specific equivalence transformations, with high-quality annotations from both models and human experts.

SCI-Verifier is a reasoning-augmented model designed for scientific verification. It leverages logical reasoning and equivalence judgment to verify LLM answers accurately while providing concise and stable outputs.

Together, SCI-VerifyBench and SCI-Verifier offer a principled framework for systematic evaluation and reliable scientific reasoning with LLMs.

## Data process

SCI-VerifyBench is a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the scientific verification capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). It showcases multi-domain proficiency across mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and QA.

The field names in the files are explained as follows:

 - **uid**：Unique identifier for each question
 - **question**: The question text,
 - **gold_answer**: The correct/reference answer,
 - **raw_llm_response**: The response generated by an LLM,
 - **llm_response**: Final result of LLM answers extracted according to rules,
 - **answer_type**: The format of the answer: "Expression",  "Numerical", "Interval", "Equation", etc.,
 - **data_source**: The source dataset from which the quesiton was taken,
 - **domain**: The domain of the problem: "math", "physics", "chemistry", "biology", or "QA",
 - **task_type**: Category corresponding to the task,
 - **gold_judgment**:  The verification judgment: true/false,
 - **aug**: Whether the answer was generated through equivalent transformation,
 - **llm**: The LLM related to the llm_response

## SCI-Verifier
We propose a two-stage post-training approach using SFT and RL to develop a scientific verifier with concise reasoning capabilities, demonstrating strong ability in judging answer equivalence.

## Experiments

### Eval
Use the following command to evaluate the verifier:

```
python src/local_eval.py \
  --model_path \
  --data_root \  
  --dataset_name \ # Location of the data: {data_root}/{dataset_name}.jsonl
  --output_dir \ # Location of the output_summary: {output_dir}/{dataset_name}/{model_name}
  --prompt_type \ #  ["instruct", "cot", "xverify"]
  --batch_size \
  --tensor_parallel_size \
  --temperature \
  --max_tokens
```

The key results on SCI-VerifyBench are as follows:
